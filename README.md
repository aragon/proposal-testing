# Aragon NodeJs Typescript Template

This template provides all the necessary configuration for running a NodeJs project with Typescript. The template uses the `@aragon/sdk-client` package to interact with Aragon Osx framework and it is configured so it does not require any additional packages to run.

This is a test for the plugin upgrade. Change the values in `constants.ts` to configure the behavior of the script.
